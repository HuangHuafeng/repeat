* improve database performance. HOW? (transaction(), commit())
* add sequence number for message
* improve the info.json update
* report progress when saving words to database?
* when downloading words, saving words to database concurrently, but NOT in the handleResponseGetAWord()!!!
* for downloading words from the server, it might be better to download one and save one, instead of downloading all and then save
(because it can fail in the network transition?)
* change the progress dialog to an object, instead of using a point
* check the crash when downloading media files in Windows
* building the list of media files could take time, so we should show progress dialog
