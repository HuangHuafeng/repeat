* downloading info.json meet ssl issue!
* add server setting in info.json
* separate pronounce and example audio when downloading

LOW PRIORITY
* building the list of media files could take time, so we should show progress dialog
* saving files to disk is slow, maybe good to use a separate thread.(This should have low priority!)


// DONE
DONE * add sequence number for message, ACTUALLY, we should have a  message header
DONE * change the progress dialog to an object, instead of using a pointer
DONE (should be related to the progress dialog pointer) * check the crash when downloading media files in Windows
DONE * improve database performance. HOW? (transaction(), commit())
DONE * improve the info.json update
NOT NEEDED AS saving NOW VERY QUICK * report progress when saving words to database?
NOT NEEDED AS saving NOW VERY QUICK * when downloading words, saving words to database concurrently, but NOT in the handleResponseGetAWord()!!!
NOT NEEDED AS saving NOW VERY QUICK * for downloading words from the server, it might be better to download one and save one, instead of downloading all and then save
(because it can fail in the network transition?)
