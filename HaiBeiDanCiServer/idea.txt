* improve database performance. HOW?
* add sequence number for message
* improve the info.json update
* report progress when saving words to database?
* when downloading words, saving words to database concurrently, but NOT in the handleResponseGetAWord()!!!
* check the crash when downloading media files in Windows
* for downloading words from the server, it might be better to download one and save one, instead of downloading all and then save
(because it can fail in the network transition?)
